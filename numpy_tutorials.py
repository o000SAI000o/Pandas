#NumPy is a Python library.
#NumPy is used for working with arrays.
#NumPy is short for Numerical Python
#NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.
#The array object in NumPy is called ndarray]

"""Why is NumPy Faster Than Lists?
NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, 
so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.
This behavior is called locality of reference in computer science."""
